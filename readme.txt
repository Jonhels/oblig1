This website have been created by Jon Helge Skj√¶rstein with studentcode 522940.
Project name: 522940-o1-idg12922022

Something I want to say about the inline style and block elements:
Website have been designed with styles that can be considered questionable if not done correctly. 
This means that inline style have been used, but only because I want to show that I completely understands how it works, there are pages that have been 
designed with block elements as well. 

Here I have used inline style to create good responsive website. 
The block element is also used to create good responsive website, but in it's own way. 

This is only been done because I wantet to test the limits of the tools we have been given.
