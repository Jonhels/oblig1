                        This is an application that I have designed in figma some years ago,
                        this application is yet to be built.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The application in itself is just created to practice my figma designing skills, this
                        application is
                        supposed to be a resume showcase app that allows users to check out a persons public resume.

                        I like to work in figma with both design and vecor art.

                        This is suppoes to be a logo for myself, the logo or mascot is called Jacke. But honestly I have
                        never used it before. Jacke will always be used when I am designing a website design since
                        he is really nice to have as a logo replacement.

                        I have created this Log Cabin in figma as vector art. The funny thing about this project is that
                        every log you see is a group by itself. This means that in the end when I wanted to put
                        everything together I had to build the log cabin as you would build a new house log after log
                        and plank after plank.
