                <h2>Website report</h2>
                <div>
                    <figure class="aboutfigure">
                        <img src="./img/Pages.png" alt="Box model">

                    <p>
                        This is the website layout shown as a box model. I have made this one in the best way that I
                        could.
                        Under I have explained my design and choices seperated into sections with h2 and a p tag for
                        each page.
                    </p>

                <h2>Index.html</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        All pages have the same navigation, this is created with ul list and a tag inside the nav tag in
                        the head element. Under we have h1 as a title and reusable div within the article.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The div consists of h2 in the centre on the top, img on left and p on the right.
                        The div is designed as an inline element because I wanted to have the content on the page
                        <em>float</em> around eachother. You can try this by scaling the window.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the bot we have the footer element, but this have not been designed or used. I added it into
                        the code to show that I know about it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        OL-list have been used to list up my hobbies.

                <h2>Resume.html</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Resume page consists of mostly the same content as index.html, but here we have the ul-list to
                        show the content. I figured that dots was the best design for this kind of content.
                    </p>

                <h2>Portfolio.html</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        This page is designed in a way to show that I understand how block elements work. Here we have
                        not the same design as index.html or
                        resume.html because both those pages used inline style to make the webpage responsive. in
                        Portfolio.html we have everything seperated as block level elements.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        h1 is page title, there is a div with h2 title and figure element with it's own pigure and
                        figcaption.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Under figure we have a p-tag that explains the content. This process have been repeated on every
                        element on the page and this will make out website clean and easy to read.

                        contact.html uses the same style as index.html and resume.html. But here we have ul with a-tag inside.
