For the full list of CSS properties, you can look at w3schools' reference.

However there are many different types of sites helping you along the way.
CSS tricks have lots of guides on styling with css, html, etc.

CSS selectors (the tags before {} you see below) are used to specify the HTML elements on our web pages that we want to style.
There are a wide variety of CSS selectors available, allowing you to select with precision which part of the page you want to design.

You can split the selectors into four main groups:
Elements, IDs, classes and Universal selectors .

Elements can be used to select ALL tags with similar to how "body" is used below. It will style the body of your document.
p { color: red }
This will give any and all paragraphs the text color red.

IDs styles the element with the name you've given. It can be recognized with a # in front.
It matches elements containing id, for example, id="warning"

Classes, these can be recognized with a . in front of a name. (for example .card)
It will select all elements with the same class name in your html document, and give it that style.
This matches elements containing class, for example, class="warning"

Universal selectors are recognized by the simple * tag. It will tell the browser to give everything within the curly brackets that style.

#header ul > li::first-letter {

#header a {
  color: inherit;

main > *,
article > * {
  margin: 20px 0;

.card {
  background: white;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  padding: 10px;
  width: 100%;
  text-align: center;
  box-shadow: 7px 7px 10px 3px darkgrey;

/*
There are four different combinators in CSS:

 -   Descendant selector (space)
 -   Child selector (>)
     The child selector selects all elements that are the immediate children of a specified element.
     Example:
        .card>div will only select divs inside something that has the class="card" attached to it.

 -   Adjacent sibling selector (+)
 -   General sibling selector (~)


A combinator is something that explains the relationship between the selectors.
Read about the rest of them on w3schools

.card > div {
  vertical-align: middle;
  display: inline-block;
}

/*
Targetted CSS
    CSS allows you to target specific elements if you so wish for it. Below you will see a specific type of targeting
    .card>div.left
    What this does is selecting the element with class="card" and then only giving the style to the DIV that has class="left" in it.

Commas (,)
    When designing a html document, you will most likely come across the time where you style two different elements the same way with the same code.
    By using a simple comma (,), this is used to separate multiple selectors and apply the same style to both of them.
    For example below:
    Any element matching ".card>div.left and/or .card>div.right" wil now get styled based on what you put inside.
*/

.card > div.left,
.card > div.right {
  height: 100%;
  width: 45%;
}

/*
This is also a form of targeted selection, it selects only the image that is inside a figure, inside a div inside a tag with the class="card" attached to it.
(*)Abusing of this kind of selectors with many nested elements may affect the performance.
*/
.card > div > figure > img {
  width: 100%;
}

.justified-text-with-padding {
  text-align: justify;
  padding: 5%;
}
